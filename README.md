### Firest create Employee calss with constructor take all properties, then I create all method needed, in update and delete function I checked before any operation if the index passed is right or not to be more secure.

### To store all emolyess i made an array of object to all of them so if I want to update or delete i had to pass the index.


### Second create book calss with constructor take all properties, then I create all method needed, in show_all function I checked before any operation if the array is empty or not.
### To store all emolyess i made an array of object to each book which i think is more secure, so if i want to edit any book or delete it i only use 'this' word.

## Finally I create objects from each class and call there function to check if the program work or not.
